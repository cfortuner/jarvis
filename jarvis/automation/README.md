# Automation

The automation package includes the actions and controllers for supported applications. In the future, we may be able to operate on raw pixels using reinforcement learning, but for now we need access to the underlying APIs for each application (GUI, Browser, Calendar, etc). Where possible, we leverage 3rd-party libraries to abstract the operating system, however, in some cases we will need to write OS-specific controllers.
