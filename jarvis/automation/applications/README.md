# automation.applications

This package includes native integrations with desktop and mobile apps. In many cases, itâ€™s simplest to call a native API, rather than parsing the GUI with OCR and using keyboard/mouse commands. For example, the Calendar App has an API we can call to create events. This will be easier than trying to manipulate the Calendar using raw Mouse + Keyboard commands.
