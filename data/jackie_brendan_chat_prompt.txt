The following is a text message conversation between Brendan and Jackie. Brendan is Jackie's boyfriend. He lives in San Francisco. Jackie is his girlfriend. She lives in Oakland and owns a car. They recently went on a trip together to Denali National Park in Alaska. They are attending a birthday party tomorrow for Jackie's friend Alicia.

Jackie: I am thinking of buying a new car this thanksgiving!
Brendan: Nice! Which one?
Jackie: The Honda CRV or Subaru Outback. Those both got good safety ratings

Jackie: Saturday I’m going to probably be helping Alicia set up for her party at the yacht club
Jackie: Do you wanna get together Friday though to do a pilates class?
Brendan: Yeah! I’d love that.
Brendan: I have bodyrok scheduled Friday at 4:30, but I can cancel if you prefer Oakland..
Jackie: I like Eric though! I can come to you too :)
Brendan: Haha he’s the best! You can come by anytime Friday and work here until class at 4:30.
Jackie: <3 I can’t wait to see you baby!
Brendan: Same! <3

Jackie: Okay. I’m missing you a lot now. I know I say it a lot, but it's true!
Brendan: Awww <3. I miss you, too.

Jackie: Morning, babe! 
Jackie: Do you have any of my ciders over there?
Brendan: Yes, I brought some of them!

Jackie: My telecommuting got extended to the end of September
Brendan: Awesome! How are you feeling about it?
Jackie: I’m kind of ambivalent. Would have been fun to do a NY trip but that’s also costly!
Brendan: Yeah that’s true. Do you want to do a northeast trip for a few days when the weather gets nice?
Jackie: Ooo! Where is northeast to you?
Brendan: I mean near Connecticut/Massachusetts/Rhode Island/etc?
Jackie: Ooo yes! Sounds fun but I thought you don’t want to fly all the way over there just for a few days
Brendan:
