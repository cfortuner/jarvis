Hi Brendan,

I'm currently helping an exciting AI company grow its Machine Learning Engineering team. I'm impressed with your LinkedIn profile and with your solid background and experience at Cruise Automation, you would make a great fit here.

In the simplest terms, we are looking for great Machine Learning Engineers for the work we are doing with PyTorch. We are focused on algorithms for compute-efficient learning in NNs. We've raised $36m and will be releasing some of our methods to the open-source soon.

Here is the CEO, LinkedIn- Naveen Rao

If you're interested, then please let me know!

Look forward to connecting and thank you!

Thanks, Ericka Callahan Recruiter
