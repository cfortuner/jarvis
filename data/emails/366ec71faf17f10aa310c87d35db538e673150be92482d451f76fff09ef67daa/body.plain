Hi Brendan,
I hope this message finds you well. I'm partnered with a leading autonomous vehicle corporation to bring on a top Staff Data Engineer, and based on your experience I think you could be a great fit.
This position is located onsite in Germany as of February 2022, and remote until then. The compensation is up to $600k base + Equity.
Would you be interested in getting connected with the Hiring Manager?
Cheers, Paul
