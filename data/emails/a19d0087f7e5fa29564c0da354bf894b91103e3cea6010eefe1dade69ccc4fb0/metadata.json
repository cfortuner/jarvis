Furthermore, without advance notice to the Passenger or purchaser, Southwest may cancel such reservations, or any other reservations that it believes, in its sole discretion, were made without intent to travel. With the exception of Southwest gift cards, funds from proactively canceled reservations by Southwest will be returned to the original form of payment. Reservations paid for with a Southwest gift card will have the amount applied from the gift card held as travel funds for use by the Customer on a future Southwest Airlines flight.  \n>   \n> | | | \n> \n> Need help?\n> \n> Contact us\n> \n> Customer service | FAQs  \n>   \n> ---  \n> | \n> \n> Connect with us  \n>   \n> ---  \n> | \n> \n> Mobile app\n> \n> Get the mobile app  \n>   \n> ---  \n>   \n> *Point Purchase Offer Terms and Conditions\n> \n> Offer valid through December 31, 2020 11:59:59 p.m. CST.
