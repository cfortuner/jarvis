RESTRICTED HAZARDOUS ITEMS

| 

To ensure the safety of our customers and employees, Delta no longer accepts hoverboards or any lithium battery powered self-balancing personal transportation devices on board its aircraft. These items are prohibited as both carry-on and checked baggage.

Spare batteries for other devices, fuel cells, and e-cigarettes are permitted in carry-on baggage only. If your carry-on bag contains these items and is gate checked, they must be removed and carried in the cabin. Further information and specific guidelines regarding restricted items can be found here.

Advisory

| 

Effective March 2015 – June 2017, passengers traveling through LAX might experience flight delays due to runway construction work by the Los Angeles World Airports organization. Delays could result in gate changes, so be sure to check your departure terminal by using Online Check-in, Flight Status or the Fly Delta app. Once at LAX, please check airport screens for the most up-to-date details.
