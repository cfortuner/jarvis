<div>Hi Brendan,</div>
<div><br/>
</div>
<div>I'm one of the founders here at Slai. Do you have time for a quick call/coffee next week?</div>
<div><br/>
</div>
<div>Slai is a tool to quickly build machine learning-powered applications. We make it easy for developers to build useful ML models without managing infrastructure.</div>
<div><br/>
</div>
<div>We're currently a team of two, and we're looking to hire our first engineer (apart from our CTO) who will be heavily involved in leading product development at the company.</div>
<div><br/>
</div>
<div>A few highlights:</div>
<div><br/>
</div>
<div>• Launched our private beta in June, and starting to onboard customers</div>
<div>• Raised pre-seed funding from some of the best founders and VCs in Silicon Valley</div>
<div>• We are solving some of the most interesting problems at the intersection of distributed systems and machine learning (think multithreading on GPUs and creating interactive coding sessions in the browser)</div>
<div><br/>
</div>
<div>Let me know if you're interested in chatting!</div>
<div><br/>
</div>
<div>-Eli</div>
