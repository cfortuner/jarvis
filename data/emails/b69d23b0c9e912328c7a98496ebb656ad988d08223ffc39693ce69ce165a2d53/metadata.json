Any taxes and fees associated with your reward travel reservation will be held for future use in the form of reusable travel funds under the name of the traveler(s).\n\nProhibition on Multiple/Conflicting Reservations: to promote seat availability for our Customers, Southwest prohibits multiple reservations for the same Passenger departing from the same city on the same date, or any multiple reservations containing conflicting or overlapping itineraries (such as departures for the same Customer from multiple cities at the same time). Furthermore, without advance notice to the Passenger or purchaser, Southwest may cancel such reservations, or any other reservations that it believes, in its sole discretion, were made without intent to travel. With the exception of Southwest gift cards, funds from proactively canceled reservations by Southwest will be returned to the original form of payment. Reservations paid for with a Southwest gift card will have the amount applied from the gift card held as travel funds for use by the Customer on a future Southwest Airlines flight.  \n  \n| | | \n\nNeed help?\n\nContact us\n\nCustomer service | FAQs  \n  \n---  \n| \n\nConnect with us  \n  \n---  \n| \n\nMobile app\n\nGet the mobile app  \n  \n---  \n  \n*Point Purchase Offer Terms and Conditions\n\nOffer valid through December 31, 2020 11:59:59 p.m. CST.
